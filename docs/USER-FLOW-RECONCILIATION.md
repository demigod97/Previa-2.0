# Previa User Flow: Reconciliation Workflow

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Purpose:** Define how users interact with Transactions, Receipts, and Reconciliation features

---

## Overview

Previa's reconciliation system helps users match transactions from bank statements to receipts for expense tracking and tax preparation. The workflow is designed to be intuitive and AI-assisted while giving users full control.

## Core Concept

```
User uploads ‚Üí AI processes ‚Üí AI suggests matches ‚Üí User approves/rejects ‚Üí Data reconciled
```

**Key Insight**: Reconciliation is **not a separate data entry task** - it's reviewing AI suggestions and confirming they're correct.

---

**What Happens Behind the Scenes:**
- Documents uploaded to Supabase Storage
- Edge Function `process-document` triggered
- n8n workflow extracts data via OCR
- Callback updates database with extracted data
- **AI automatically runs matching algorithm** ‚Üí creates suggestions in `reconciliation_matches` table

**User Feedback:**

## How Features Connect

### Receipts Library vs Reconciliation Engine

**Common Confusion**: "What's the difference?"

| **Receipts Library** (`/receipts`) | **Reconciliation Engine** (`/reconciliation`) |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Browse ALL receipts | Review AI-SUGGESTED MATCHES |
| Search, filter, sort receipts | Approve/reject match suggestions |
| View individual receipt details | Compare transaction vs receipt side-by-side |
| Manage receipt lifecycle | Manage matching lifecycle |
| Independent of transactions | Requires both transaction AND receipt |

**Analogy**:
- **Receipts Library** = Your physical receipt folder (organized, searchable)
- **Reconciliation Engine** = Your accountant's desk (comparing receipts to bank statement)

### When to Use Each View

**Use `/receipts` when:**
- "I need to find that Bunnings receipt from last month"
- "How many receipts did I upload in March?"
- "Which receipts failed OCR processing?"
- "I want to delete a duplicate receipt"

**Use `/reconciliation` when:**
- "I need to approve matches suggested by AI"
- "Is this receipt for the Coles transaction on 15/10?"
- "I want to manually match a transaction to a receipt"
- "How many transactions are still unreconciled?"

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Upload regularly** (weekly recommended)
   - Upload bank statements monthly
   - Upload receipts as you receive them
   - More frequent = better AI accuracy

2. **Review matches within 7 days**
   - Memory is fresh
   - Easier to verify accuracy
   - Gamification streaks reward consistency

3. **Start with high-confidence matches**
   - Approve "easy wins" first (green badges)
   - Build momentum
   - Review medium/low confidence carefully

4. **Use filters effectively**
   - Filter by date range for tax quarters
   - Filter by category for budget review
   - Sort by amount to find large expenses

5. **Don't over-reject**
   - If match looks close but not perfect, check original documents
   - AI learns from approvals/rejections
   - False rejections hurt future accuracy

### For Developers

1. **Confidence thresholds** (from `match-receipt-transactions` Edge Function):
   - High ‚â•0.80 - Safe for bulk approve
   - Medium 0.50-0.79 - Review individually
   - Low <0.50 - Likely incorrect, but show for manual matching

2. **Match criteria** (stored in JSONB):
   ```json
   {
     "date_difference_days": 0-3,
     "amount_difference": "$0-$5",
     "merchant_similarity": "60-100%",
     "reason": "Exact amount + date match + merchant 'Woolworths' similar to 'WOOLWORTHS PTY LTD'"
   }
   ```

3. **Status transitions** (enforce with database triggers):
   ```
   Transaction Status Flow:
   unreconciled ‚Üí matched ‚Üí approved
                         ‚Üò rejected ‚Üí unreconciled

   Receipt Status Flow:
   pending ‚Üí processing ‚Üí completed ‚Üí matched ‚Üí approved
                                              ‚Üò rejected ‚Üí completed
   ```

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

   - Auto-crop and enhance image

3. **Advanced Matching Rules**
   - User-defined merchant mappings ("WLWTHS" ‚Üí "Woolworths")
   - Recurring expense templates
   - Split transactions (one receipt ‚Üí multiple line items)

4. **Receipt Sharing**
   - Export receipt + transaction as PDF
   - Share with accountant
   - Attach to Xero/QuickBooks invoice

5. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Spending trends by category
   - Monthly comparison charts
   - Tax deduction estimator
   - Budget vs actual variance

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find my receipt"
1. Check `/receipts` page with filters
2. Search by merchant name
3. Check processing status (might be pending/failed)
4. View "Recent Uploads" in dashboard

### "AI suggested wrong match"
1. Click "Reject Match" - won't suggest again
2. Use "Manual Match" to find correct receipt
3. Provide feedback (future: thumbs down icon)

### "Transaction has no suggestions"
1. Upload receipt if missing
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for AI processing
3. Click "Manual Match" to search receipts
4. Create manual match (confidence=100%)

### "Approved match by mistake"
1. Go to "Recent Approvals" section
2. Click "Undo" (available for last 5 matches)
3. Re-review suggestion
4. Approve or reject correctly

---

## Accessibility

All reconciliation features follow WCAG AA standards:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through matches, Enter to approve/reject
- **Screen Reader Support**: Confidence badges have descriptive labels
- **Color + Text**: Status not conveyed by color alone (emojis + text)
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear outlines on interactive elements
- **Skip Links**: "Skip to matches" link at top of page

---

## Performance

**Target Metrics:**
- Match suggestion generation: <30 seconds per batch (10 receipts)
- Page load time: <2 seconds (`/reconciliation`)
- Filter/sort operations: <500ms (client-side)
- Approve/reject action: <1 second (database update)

**Optimization:**
- AI matching runs async (doesn't block UI)
- Pagination for large datasets (50 items per page)
- Lazy loading for receipt images
- Debounced search inputs (300ms delay)

---

## Summary

**Previa's reconciliation workflow is designed to be:**

1. ‚úÖ **AI-Assisted** - Automation reduces manual work by 70%+
2. ‚úÖ **User-Controlled** - You approve/reject every match
3. ‚úÖ **Intuitive** - Side-by-side comparison makes verification easy
4. ‚úÖ **Forgiving** - Undo recent mistakes, retry failed processing
5. ‚úÖ **Rewarding** - Gamification makes reconciliation engaging

**The user journey in one sentence:**
> Upload documents ‚Üí AI finds matches ‚Üí You approve them ‚Üí Done!

**Golden Rule:**
> If you're unsure about a match, reject it. Manual matching is always available, and accuracy > speed.
