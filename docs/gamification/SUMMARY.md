## 🔑 Key Features & Innovations

### 1. **Australian-First Approach**
Unlike generic gamification, every badge, tip, and module is designed for the Australian financial system. References to Big Four banks, ASIC, ATO, SG rates, HECS/HELP, GST, and ACL make this uniquely valuable for Australian users.

### 2. **Data-Driven Achievements**
Beyond simple action counting, the system analyzes transaction patterns to award badges for:
- Identifying duplicate subscriptions (savings potential)
- Budget adherence across categories
- Tax readiness with work expense tagging
- Savings streaks and cash flow management

### 3. **Educational Integration**
Each educational module:
- Aligns with Australian Curriculum standards
- Includes 10-20 quiz questions (80% pass threshold)
- Awards a completion badge
- Links to official ASIC/ATO resources
- Tracks time spent and progress percentage

### 4. **Contextual Learning**
Tips are triggered by user actions:
- Upload receipt → "Keep receipts over $300 for ATO compliance"
- Tag work expense → "Must pass 3-part test: spent it, work-related, have records"
- First reconciliation → "Reconcile weekly for better cash flow visibility"

### 5. **Scalable Architecture**
JSONB fields allow:
- Flexible badge unlock logic without schema changes
- Rich module content with sections, quizzes, and examples
- Complex insight metadata for transaction analysis
- Easy addition of new badges/tips/modules
