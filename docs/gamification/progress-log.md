## 🔍 Key Decisions & Notes

### Design Decisions
- **Badge Rarity Distribution:** Balanced across 4 tiers to maintain engagement
- **Tip Context Triggers:** 15+ trigger events for contextual tip display
- **Age Group Segmentation:** Tips targeted to 18-25, 25-35, 30-50, and all
- **Australian Compliance:** All content references current 2024-25 rates and regulations

### Technical Decisions
- **Database Schema:** Separated badge definitions from user progress for flexibility
- **RLS Policies:** Public read for badges/tips, user-scoped for progress/insights
- **Helper Functions:** Centralized level calculation and badge award logic
- **JSONB Fields:** Used for flexible content storage (module sections, unlock logic)

### Content Decisions
- **ASIC MoneySmart Integration:** External links to official government resources
- **ATO References:** Direct links to relevant ATO guidance pages
- **Educational Modules:** Quiz pass threshold set at 80% for badge unlock
- **Points Economy:** Total possible: 6,950 points from badges alone
