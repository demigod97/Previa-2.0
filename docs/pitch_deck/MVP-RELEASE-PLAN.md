## AI/ML Model Documentation

### Models in Use

1. **Receipt OCR:**
   - **Model:** Mistral API (via n8n workflows)
   - **Purpose:** Extract structured data from receipt images
   - **Justification:** High accuracy for Australian receipts, cost-effective (~$0.10/1M tokens), fast processing (<2s)

2. **Transaction Reconciliation:**
   - **Model:** GPT-4o-mini (via n8n workflows)
   - **Purpose:** Match transactions to receipts with confidence scoring
   - **Justification:** Handles fuzzy matching, date proximity, amount variations

3. **Category Inference:**
   - **Model:** Rule-based + pattern matching (80+ Australian merchants)
   - **Purpose:** Auto-categorize transactions
   - **Justification:** Deterministic for known merchants, fast, no API costs

4. **Financial Chat Assistant (planned):**
   - **Model:** Gemini (primary), GPT-4o (fallback)
   - **Purpose:** Answer user questions about finances
   - **Justification:** Gemini cost-effective, GPT-4o for complex queries

### Training Data

1. **Receipt OCR:**
   - **Source:** Mock receipts (8 Australian merchants)
   - **Validation:** Manual verification against ground truth
   - **Performance:** 95%+ accuracy on standard receipts

2. **Transaction Matching:**
   - **Source:** Synthetic bank statement data (3 banks)
   - **Validation:** Confidence scoring (High ‚â•0.80, Medium 0.50-0.79, Low <0.50)
   - **Performance:** 70%+ automation rate target

3. **Category Inference:**
   - **Source:** 80+ curated merchant patterns
   - **Validation:** Test suite with known merchant names
   - **Performance:** 90%+ accuracy for known merchants

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

1. **AI Model Accuracy:**
   - **Risk:** Incorrect receipt parsing or transaction matching
   - **Mitigation:** Confidence scores, manual review workflow, user corrections

2. **Data Privacy:**
   - **Risk:** Exposure of sensitive financial data
   - **Mitigation:** RLS policies, encrypted storage, no logging of PII

3. **Performance:**
   - **Risk:** Slow processing for large datasets
   - **Mitigation:** Async processing, status tracking, chunked operations

### Product Risks

1. **User Adoption:**
   - **Risk:** Complex workflows deter users
   - **Mitigation:** Setup wizard, gamification, video tutorials

2. **Data Quality:**
   - **Risk:** Poor OCR on low-quality receipts
   - **Mitigation:** Upload validation, manual entry fallback, clear error messages
