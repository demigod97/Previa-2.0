# **Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI-Driven Financial Intelligence Platform**

#### **1. Goals and Background Context**

**Goals**
* Achieve product-market fit by delivering a high-quality, AI-driven financial intelligence and pre-accounting MVP.
* Establish a sustainable freemium business model for long-term growth.
* Secure seed funding based on a functional MVP, validated user traction, and a clear roadmap.

**Background Context**
The project is a direct response to the prevalent struggles faced by individuals, freelancers, and small businesses in managing their finances. The market lacks simple, automated, and educational tools that directly address the administrative burden of reconciliation and bookkeeping. This platform aims to fill that gap by focusing on the Australian household market as the primary segment for the MVP. The foundation of this project is a manual-first approach, which allows for rapid prototyping and validation of the core AI reconciliation engine before pursuing the complex and costly Open Banking accreditation.

#### **3. User Interface Design Goals**

**Overall UX Vision**
The user experience should be simple, intuitive, and trustworthy. The app should feel more like a personal financial assistant than a complex accounting tool, reducing the stress associated with financial management. It must be accessible to users with a wide range of financial literacy levels.

**Key Interaction Paradigms**
* **Effortless Onboarding**: The user's first experience must be seamless, guiding them through the manual data upload process with clear and simple instructions.
* **AI as a Partner**: The AI's role should be to make suggestions and automate tasks, not to act as a black box. Users should always feel in control, with the ability to review and approve all AI actions.
* **Gamified Feedback Loops**: User interactions will be reinforced with gamified elements, such as progress bars, points, and rewards, to promote positive financial habits.
* **Contextual Help**: Help and guidance should be available at the moment of need, without disrupting the user's workflow.

**Core Screens and Views**
The MVP includes 12 primary screens organized into 4 main flows:

**Onboarding Flow (5-7 screens):**
1. Welcome & Value Proposition
2. Account Creation (Supabase Auth)
3. Upload First Bank Statement
4. AI Extraction & Account Setup
5. Transaction Preview
6. Onboarding Complete (gamification intro)

**Main Dashboard (Multi-View):**
7. Home/Overview - Widgets showing spending, income, categories, trends
8. Reconciliation Engine - Side-by-side transaction/receipt matching interface
9. Transaction Table - Filterable, sortable list with batch actions
10. AI Chat Assistant - Financial guidance with citations

**Document Management:**
11. Upload Hub - Drag/drop for statements/receipts with status tracking
12. Document Library - All uploaded sources with processing status

Each screen will be built with shadcn/ui components following the Previa design system.

**Accessibility**
* **Accessibility**: I am assuming a baseline of WCAG AA accessibility compliance to ensure the app is usable by a broad audience.

**Branding & Visual Identity**

**Color Palette:**
Previa uses a warm, trustworthy color scheme designed to make financial management feel approachable:

| Color Name | Hex | Usage |
|------------|-----|-------|
| Cream | #F2E9D8 | Primary background, light surfaces |
| Stone Gray | #8C877D | Secondary text, borders |
| Sand | #D9C8B4 | Accent elements, hover states |
| Charcoal | #403B31 | Primary text, headings |
| Dark Stone | #595347 | Secondary headings, icons |

**Logo:**
The Previa logo (fingerprint design) represents the unique financial journey of each user. See `Asset 1L1.svg` for implementation.

**Design Influences:**
- **Monarch Money:** Clean transaction tables, confidence indicators, category visualization
- **Expensify:** Receipt scanning UX, approval workflows
- **PocketSmith:** Multi-account dashboards, calendar-based views

**Target Device and Platforms**
* **Target Platforms**: The product will be a Web Responsive application for desktop users and a dedicated mobile app for Android and iOS devices.

#### **4. Technical Assumptions**

**Repository Structure: Monorepo**
* **Rationale:** A monorepo approach is recommended to manage the codebase for both the mobile and web applications, as well as the backend services. This structure promotes code sharing between the frontend and backend, which can be highly efficient for development and maintenance.

**Service Architecture: Serverless**
* **Rationale:** Given the use of n8n and Langflow for automation and AI tasks, a serverless architecture is a natural fit for the MVP. It allows for a highly scalable, pay-per-use model that is ideal for managing costs in the early stages of a startup.

**Frontend Framework: React**
* **Rationale:** We will use React with a mobile-first approach for the frontend. This framework is a great choice because of its large community, extensive library of components, and ability to build both web and mobile applications with tools like React Native in the future.
* **Styling Framework:** Tailwind CSS is recommended for styling, as it allows for rapid and consistent UI development.

**LLM Provider: TBD**
* **Rationale:** The choice of LLM is critical for the AI reconciliation engine. We will use a provider that offers a balance of performance, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness for our MVP.
* **Options:**
    1. **Google's Gemini**: A powerful model with a large context window, which is ideal for processing entire documents like bank statements.
    2. **OpenAI's GPT-4o**: A well-known and robust model that is highly capable for a variety of tasks.
    3. **Anthropic's Claude**: Another strong option, especially for handling complex tasks and large text inputs.

**Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration**
* **Rationale:** For the MVP, a testing strategy that focuses on Unit and Integration tests will provide a strong foundation for quality without requiring the time and resources of a full testing pyramid. This approach balances speed and quality, ensuring core functionality is reliable while allowing for rapid development.

**Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**
* **Language and Frameworks:** The primary language for the project will be JavaScript/TypeScript. The frontend will be built with a modern framework like React, and the backend services will use Node.js.
* **External Services:** We will leverage Supabase for our database and authentication needs, and use n8n and Langflow to manage our back-end workflows and AI logic.
* **UI Component Strategy:** shadcn/ui with Model Context Protocol (MCP) for rapid, consistent component generation aligned with Previa design system.

#### **5. Epic List**

**1. Epic 1: Foundation & Core Services**
* **Goal**: Establish the technical foundation with monorepo setup, database schema (bank accounts, statements, receipts, transactions, reconciliation_matches), user authentication, and user/premium_user tier implementation. Apply Previa branding (color palette, logo) and configure shadcn/ui with design tokens.

**2. Epic 2: User Onboarding & Bank Account Setup**
* **Goal**: Build the interactive onboarding flow (5-7 steps) that guides users to upload their first bank statement, extract account details via OCR/AI, and create their first bank account with user confirmation. Introduce gamification elements.

**3. Epic 3: Document Upload & OCR Processing**
* **Goal**: Implement document upload hub (drag/drop, validation) for bank statements and receipts. Build the OCR â†’ AI extraction pipeline via n8n, with processing status tracking and confidence scoring.

**4. Epic 4: AI Reconciliation Engine & Matching UI**
* **Goal**: Deliver the core value proposition with the AI reconciliation engine that matches transactions to receipts. Build the matching interface (side-by-side comparison, confidence indicators, approve/reject workflows) inspired by Monarch and Expensify patterns.

**5. Epic 5: Multi-View Dashboard & Financial Insights**
* **Goal**: Build the primary user-facing dashboard with 4 views: Home (widgets for spending/income/trends), Reconciliation Engine, Transaction Table (filterable/sortable), and AI Chat Assistant. Include gamified financial literacy elements.

**6. Epic 6: Data Export & Integrations**
* **Goal**: Allow users to export reconciled data in standardized formats (CSV/JSON) compatible with Xero and QuickBooks. Prepare architecture for future direct API integrations.
