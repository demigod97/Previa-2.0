# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* Achieve product-market fit by delivering a high-quality, AI-driven financial intelligence and pre-accounting MVP.
* Establish a sustainable freemium business model for long-term growth.
* Secure seed funding based on a functional MVP, validated user traction, and a clear roadmap.

## Background Context
The project is a direct response to the prevalent struggles faced by individuals, freelancers, and small businesses in managing their finances. The market lacks simple, automated, and educational tools that directly address the administrative burden of reconciliation and bookkeeping. This platform aims to fill that gap by focusing on the Australian household market as the primary segment for the MVP. The foundation of this project is a manual-first approach, which allows for rapid prototyping and validation of the core AI reconciliation engine before pursuing the complex and costly Open Banking accreditation.
