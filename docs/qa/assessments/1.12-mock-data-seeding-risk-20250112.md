## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **SEC-001**: Authentication bypass tests, invalid token scenarios
- **DATA-001**: Partial failure tests, data validation scenarios
- **PERF-001**: Load tests with maximum data generation
- **SEC-002**: Rate limiting bypass attempts, concurrent requests

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Integration tests for database transactions
- Performance tests for Edge Function timeout scenarios
- Security tests for rate limiting effectiveness

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for data generation
- UI/UX tests for error handling
- Regression tests for existing functionality

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- **SEC-001**: Unauthorized data generation (Critical)
- **DATA-001**: Data corruption prevention (High)
- **PERF-001**: Edge Function timeout handling (High)
- **SEC-002**: Rate limiting bypass prevention (High)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- **DATA-002**: Invalid data format (Medium) - with validation
- **PERF-002**: Database performance (Medium) - with monitoring
- **BUS-001**: User experience (Medium) - with error handling

### Accepted Risks

- **DATA-003**: Gamification inconsistency (Low) - acceptable for MVP
- **BUS-002**: Feature completeness (Low) - can be improved iteratively
- **OPS-001**: Error monitoring (Low) - can be enhanced post-launch
- **OPS-002**: Knowledge transfer (Low) - documentation can be added

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance**: Edge Function execution time, database query performance
- **Security**: Authentication failures, rate limiting violations
- **Data**: Data generation success rates, validation failures
- **Business**: User adoption rates, feature usage metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Edge Function architecture changes
- New authentication mechanisms added
- Database schema modifications
- Performance issues reported
- Security vulnerabilities discovered

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Actions (Before Development)

1. **Security Review**: Validate authentication implementation in Edge Function
2. **Performance Planning**: Design efficient data generation algorithms
3. **Rate Limiting Design**: Implement robust server-side rate limiting
4. **Error Handling**: Design comprehensive error handling and rollback

### Development Phase Actions

1. **Code Review**: Focus on authentication, data validation, performance
2. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test coverage for all risk scenarios
3. **Monitoring**: Add logging and metrics for all critical paths
4. **Documentation**: Document error handling and recovery procedures

### Post-Deployment Actions

1. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for all critical risk indicators
2. **Performance**: Monitor Edge Function execution times and database performance
3. **Security**: Track authentication failures and rate limiting violations
4. **User Feedback**: Monitor user experience and feature adoption

## Quality Gate Impact

Based on risk assessment:
- **1 Critical Risk** → Gate = FAIL (must be addressed)
- **3 High Risks** → Gate = CONCERNS (should be mitigated)
- **5 Medium Risks** → Gate = CONCERNS (monitor and plan mitigation)
- **3 Low Risks** → Gate = PASS (acceptable for deployment)

**Overall Gate Recommendation**: CONCERNS - Address critical security risk and high-priority risks before production deployment.
