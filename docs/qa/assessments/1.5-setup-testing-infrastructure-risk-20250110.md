**Story Title**: Setup Testing Infrastructure

---

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified**: 8
- **Critical Risks**: 2
- **High Risks**: 2
- **Medium Risks**: 2
- **Low Risks**: 2
- **Overall Risk Score**: 52/100 (Moderate-High Risk)

---

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [SEC-001]: RLS Policy Testing Gaps

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Row Level Security policies are complex, multi-layered, and difficult to replicate outside production database environment
**Impact**: High (3) - Inadequate RLS testing creates severe security vulnerabilities where users could access financial data across role boundaries (Administrator vs Executive data leakage)

**Why This is Critical**:
- Financial data segregation is a core security requirement
- RLS policies enforce role-based access at database level
- Mock testing may not catch subtle RLS misconfigurations
- Production data breach would violate compliance requirements

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Preventive Actions**:
   - Create dedicated Supabase development branch for RLS testing (use `mcp__supabase__create_branch`)
   - Implement RLS policy testing helpers with real database connection
   - Add automated RLS verification tests that create test users with different roles
   - Document RLS policy testing patterns in testing guide
   - Create RLS policy regression test suite

2. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Security testing scenarios for each RLS policy
   - Cross-role access attempt tests (expect failures)
   - Edge case testing: policy boundaries, NULL values, complex joins
   - Integration tests using real Supabase instance (branch environment)

3. **Residual Risk**: Low - With proper dev branch testing, RLS policies can be validated before production deployment

4. **Owner**: Developer (with QA guidance)
5. **Timeline**: Must complete before Story 1.5 acceptance

---

### 2. [TECH-003]: Supabase Mocking Complexity

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Supabase client has complex API surface including auth, RLS, real-time subscriptions, and storage
**Impact**: High (3) - Inaccurate mocks create false test confidence, leading to production failures in authentication flows, file uploads, or real-time features

**Why This is Critical**:
- Financial workflows depend on accurate Supabase operations
- Mock divergence from real behavior is common and insidious
- Authentication mocking especially prone to false positives
- File upload testing for bank statements requires realistic mocking

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Preventive Actions**:
   - Use `@supabase/supabase-js` actual library for integration tests (dev branch)
   - Create thin mock wrappers that mirror actual Supabase API signatures exactly
   - Implement mock verification tests that compare mock behavior to real client
   - Use TypeScript strict mode to catch API signature drift
   - Document clear boundaries: when to use mocks vs real client

2. **Mock Architecture**:
   ```typescript
   // Layered approach:
   // - Unit tests: Full mocks for isolation
   // - Integration tests: Real Supabase client (dev branch)
   // - E2E tests: Real Supabase client (staging environment)
   ```

3. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Mock validation suite comparing mock vs real behavior
   - Integration tests using Supabase dev branch
   - Contract tests ensuring mock API matches real Supabase client
   - Regular mock refresh based on Supabase client updates

4. **Residual Risk**: Medium - Some edge cases may still slip through, requires ongoing maintenance

5. **Owner**: Developer
6. **Timeline**: Critical for AC3 completion

---

## High Priority Risks

### 3. [TECH-001]: Incomplete Mock Data Coverage

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Existing fixtures cover happy paths but edge cases require explicit attention
**Impact**: High (3) - Missing edge case data means tests don't catch production failures

**Current State**: `src/test/fixtures/financial-data.ts` has comprehensive mock data for 6 entities, but lacks:
- Failed OCR processing scenarios
- Reconciliation timeout cases
- File upload errors
- Network failure simulations

**Mitigation**:
- Expand mock fixtures to include all failure modes documented in story (lines 115-120)
- Create helper functions for generating data variations (AC2, line 30)
- Add edge case fixtures: negative amounts, zero balances, date boundary cases
- Document fixture usage patterns in testing guide

**Testing Requirements**:
- Verify each fixture loads without errors
- Validate fixture data matches database schema
- Test edge case fixtures trigger expected error handling

**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: Required for AC2 completion

---

### 4. [DATA-001]: Test Data Financial Accuracy

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - JavaScript's floating-point arithmetic is inherently imprecise for currency
**Impact**: High (3) - Financial calculation bugs in tests mask production errors, leading to incorrect balances/reconciliations

**Context**: Story references "avoid floating-point errors" (line 88) as critical requirement

**Mitigation**:
1. **Preventive Actions**:
   - Use integer representation for currency (cents, not dollars)
   - Implement decimal.js or similar library for precise calculations
   - Create financial calculation test utilities with known-good values
   - Document currency handling standards in testing guide

2. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Currency arithmetic unit tests with precise decimal expectations
   - Rounding behavior tests (banker's rounding)
   - Edge cases: very large amounts, negative amounts, zero
   - Cross-currency calculations (if applicable)

3. **Test Data Examples**:
   ```typescript
   // BAD: amount: 10.50 (floating-point)
   // GOOD: amount_cents: 1050 (integer)
   ```

**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: Must establish before financial feature testing (Epic 2+)

## Medium Priority Risks

### 5. [TECH-002]: Test Setup Configuration Errors

**Score: 4 (Medium Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Story notes src/test-setup.ts "needs verification" (line 77)
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Broken setup file prevents all tests from running

**Mitigation**:
- Verify src/test-setup.ts exists and configures correctly
- Add setup file validation tests
- Document setup file purpose and configuration
- Create setup verification script in package.json

**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: AC1 verification task (line 25)

---

### 6. [OPS-001]: Missing Test Documentation

**Score: 4 (Medium Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Documentation is planned but not yet created (AC7, lines 54-59)
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Without clear guidance, developers write inconsistent or ineffective tests

**Mitigation**:
- Create comprehensive testing documentation per AC7
- Include all topics listed in lines 189-195
- Provide code examples for common patterns
- Add troubleshooting guide for test failures

**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: Required for AC7 completion

---

## Low Priority Risks

### 7. [TECH-004]: Coverage Threshold Configuration

**Score: 2 (Low Risk)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Story clearly specifies 80% thresholds (lines 176-180)
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Incorrect thresholds could allow undertested code

**Mitigation**:
- Verify coverage thresholds in vitest.config.ts match story requirements
- Add coverage enforcement to CI/CD pipeline
- Document coverage expectations per module type

**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: AC5 task

---

### 8. [PERF-001]: Slow Test Execution

**Score: 2 (Low Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - No explicit parallelization or performance strategy
**Impact**: Low (1) - Slower developer feedback, reduced productivity

**Mitigation**:
- Configure Vitest test parallelization
- Use test.concurrent for independent tests
- Monitor test execution times in CI
- Document performance expectations

**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: Nice-to-have optimization

## Quality Gate Impact

Based on this risk profile, the following gate recommendation applies:

- **2 Critical Risks (score 9)** → **Gate Decision: CONCERNS**
- **Rationale**: Story cannot proceed to "Ready for QA" until SEC-001 and TECH-003 have documented mitigation implementations
- **Waiver Authority**: Tech Lead or Product Owner can waive if mitigation plans are approved and resourced

---

## Conclusion

Story 1.5 establishes critical testing infrastructure for a financial application, making test accuracy paramount. The two critical risks (RLS testing gaps and Supabase mocking complexity) are **entirely mitigatable** through the documented strategies, primarily by using real Supabase dev branches for integration testing and implementing rigorous mock validation.

The high-risk items (incomplete mock coverage and financial accuracy) are well-understood and have clear remediation paths. Overall, this story has **moderate-high risk** that can be reduced to **low risk** through careful implementation of the mitigation strategies outlined above.

**Key Success Factor**: Prioritize real database testing for security-critical RLS policies over pure mocking approaches. Financial accuracy requires both precise mock data (integer cents) and comprehensive edge case coverage.
