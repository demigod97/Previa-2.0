# Risk Profile: Story 1.8

Date: 2025-01-12
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 75/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TEST-001: Integration Test Failures

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - 17 test failures indicate systematic issues
**Impact**: High - Test failures suggest potential production issues

**Mitigation**:
- Fix database connection issues in integration tests
- Resolve RLS policy test failures
- Address authentication setup in test environment
- Verify test data seeding processes

**Testing Focus**: All integration tests must pass before production deployment

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Testing: 1 risk (1 critical)
- Performance: 1 risk (1 medium)
- Code Quality: 1 risk (1 high)
- Mobile: 1 risk (1 medium)

### By Component

- Frontend: 2 risks
- Backend: 1 risk
- Testing: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Score | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|----------|-------------|-------|-------------|---------|------------|
| TEST-001 | Integration test failures | 9 | High | High | Fix test setup and database connections |
| LINT-001 | Linting issues (141 problems) | 6 | High | Medium | Address TypeScript and React hook violations |
| PERF-001 | Bundle size growth (1.27MB) | 4 | Medium | Medium | Implement lazy loading and code splitting |
| MOBILE-001 | Mobile responsiveness incomplete | 4 | Medium | Medium | Complete Phase 7 implementation |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Fix all 17 failing integration tests
- Verify database connection and RLS policies
- Test authentication flows end-to-end
- Validate financial data integrity

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Address linting violations systematically
- Test TypeScript type safety
- Verify React hook dependencies
- Code quality review

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests

- Performance testing with large datasets
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Bundle size analysis
- User experience testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- All high risks (score 6+)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with monitoring in place
- Performance optimization roadmap

### Accepted Risks

- Mobile responsiveness can be addressed in Phase 7
- Bundle size optimization can be addressed in Phase 8

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Test suite stability and pass rates
- Bundle size and performance metrics
- Mobile user experience metrics
- Code quality metrics (linting)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Test failures are resolved
- Linting issues are addressed
- Mobile responsiveness is implemented
- Performance optimizations are completed
