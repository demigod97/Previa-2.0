  - Given: Chat message data
  - When: Message component renders
  - Then: User and AI messages display with correct styling

- **Integration Test**: `src/test/chat/FinancialChatPanel.test.tsx::message flow`
  - Given: User sends financial query
  - When: Chat panel processes message
  - Then: AI response is received and displayed

#### AC4: Reconciliation View

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `src/test/reconciliation/TransactionCard.test.tsx::drag functionality`
  - Given: Unmatched transaction
  - When: User drags transaction card
  - Then: Drag state is properly managed

- **Integration Test**: `src/test/reconciliation/MatchingPreview.test.tsx::match creation`
  - Given: Transaction and receipt selected
  - When: User approves match
  - Then: Match is created in database

#### AC5: Transactions Table View

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `src/test/transactions/TransactionTableColumns.test.tsx::column rendering`
  - Given: Transaction data
  - When: Table columns render
  - Then: All required columns are displayed

- **Integration Test**: `src/test/transactions/TransactionsView.test.tsx::table functionality`
  - Given: Large transaction dataset
  - When: User interacts with table
  - Then: Sorting, filtering, and pagination work correctly

**Missing Coverage**:
- CSV export functionality testing
- Batch operations testing
- Edit transaction dialog testing

#### AC6: Enhanced Dashboard Features

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `src/test/dashboard/FinancialOverviewCards.test.tsx::displays counts`
  - Given: Financial data
  - When: Overview cards render
  - Then: Account, transaction, and receipt counts are displayed

**Missing Coverage**:
- Component extraction testing
- Hover effects testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing

### Critical Gaps

1. **Mobile Responsiveness (Phase 7)**
   - Gap: No mobile-specific tests implemented
   - Risk: High - Mobile users may have poor experience
   - Action: Implement mobile responsiveness tests

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Gap: No performance tests for large datasets
   - Risk: Medium - Performance issues with large transaction lists
   - Action: Add performance tests for table virtualization

3. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Gap: No WCAG AA compliance testing
   - Risk: Medium - Accessibility requirements not validated
   - Action: Add accessibility tests for all components

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Additional test scenarios needed**:
   - Mobile responsiveness tests for all views
   - Performance tests for large datasets
   - Accessibility tests for WCAG AA compliance
   - CSV export functionality tests

2. **Test types to implement**:
   - Unit tests for mobile-specific components
   - Performance tests for table virtualization
   - Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation
   - Integration tests for export functionality

3. **Test data requirements**:
   - Large transaction datasets for performance testing
   - Mobile viewport test data
   - Accessibility test scenarios

4. **Mock/stub strategies**:
   - Mock mobile viewport sizes
   - Stub performance measurement APIs
   - Mock accessibility testing tools

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Mobile responsiveness without test coverage
- **Medium Risk**: Performance and accessibility gaps
- **Low Risk**: Core functionality well-tested

## Quality Indicators

Good traceability shows:

- Every AC has test coverage
- Critical paths have multiple test levels
- Edge cases are explicitly covered
- NFRs have appropriate test types

## Red Flags

Watch for:

- ACs with no test coverage
- Tests that don't map to requirements
- Vague test descriptions
- Missing edge case coverage
- NFRs without specific tests
