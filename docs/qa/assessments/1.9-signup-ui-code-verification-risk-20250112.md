## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **SEC-001**: Server-side code validation testing, security penetration testing
- **DATA-001**: Database transaction testing, failure scenario testing, data integrity validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **SEC-002**: Client-side security testing, code exposure validation
- **SEC-003**: Rate limiting testing, brute force protection testing
- **DATA-002**: Duplicate user prevention testing, email uniqueness validation

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **TECH-001**: Cross-browser testing, auto-focus behavior validation
- **PERF-001**: Database performance testing, query optimization validation
- **TECH-002**: Paste functionality testing, keyboard navigation testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (SEC-001, DATA-001)
- High risks affecting security/data (SEC-002, SEC-003, DATA-002)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls (TECH-001, PERF-001)
- Low risks with monitoring in place (TECH-002, TECH-003, BUS-001, OPS-001)

### Accepted Risks

- DATA-003: Code usage tracking gaps (minimal impact, can be addressed in future iteration)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Security Metrics**: Failed code validation attempts, suspicious sign-up patterns
- **Data Integrity**: Orphaned user records, incomplete profile creation
- **Performance**: Database query response times, sign-up flow completion rates
- **User Experience**: Form abandonment rates, error message frequency

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Supabase authentication configuration changes
- New security vulnerabilities discovered in authentication libraries
- Database schema modifications
- Performance issues reported in sign-up flow
- Regulatory requirements change for user data handling

## Mitigation Strategies

### SEC-001: Code Validation Bypass

  testing_requirements:
    - 'Security testing with OWASP ZAP'
    - 'Manual penetration testing of validation endpoints'

    - 'Add security headers (CSP, HSTS)'
  testing_requirements:
    - 'Client-side security testing'
    - 'Code exposure validation'

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. **Security Testing First**: Focus on code validation security
2. **Database Transaction Testing**: Ensure atomic user creation
3. **Integration Testing**: Validate complete sign-up flow
4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensure consistent user experience

### Development Focus
1. **Server-Side Validation**: Never trust client-side validation
2. **Database Transactions**: Use atomic operations for user creation
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error scenarios
4. **Security Headers**: Add proper security controls

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Phased Rollout**: Deploy with feature flags for gradual rollout
2. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement comprehensive monitoring before deployment
3. **Rollback Plan**: Prepare rollback procedures for critical failures
4. **Security Review**: Conduct security review before production deployment

### Monitoring Setup
1. **Security Alerts**: Failed validation attempts, suspicious patterns
2. **Data Integrity**: Orphaned records, incomplete profiles
3. **Performance Metrics**: Response times, completion rates
4. **User Experience**: Form abandonment, error rates
