# Risk Profile: Story 1.9

Date: 2025-01-12
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 3
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 40/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Client-Side Code Validation Bypass

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Easy to exploit with browser dev tools
**Impact**: High - Complete security bypass, unauthorized account creation
**Mitigation**:
- Implement Edge Function for server-side validation
- Move code verification to RPC function
- Add server-side rate limiting
**Testing Focus**: Penetration testing of code bypass scenarios

### 2. SEC-002: No Rate Limiting on Code Validation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Automated attacks possible
**Impact**: High - Brute force attacks, system abuse
**Mitigation**:
- Add rate limiting middleware
- Implement exponential backoff
- Monitor for suspicious patterns
**Testing Focus**: Load testing with rapid code attempts

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Score | Description | Mitigation |
|---------|----------|-------|--------------|------------|
| SEC-001 | Security | 9 | Client-side code validation bypass | Server-side validation |
| SEC-002 | Security | 6 | No rate limiting on validation | Add rate limiting |
| PERF-001 | Performance | 4 | Database queries on every attempt | Add caching |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Test code bypass scenarios
- Test rate limiting effectiveness
- Test server-side validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Test brute force attack scenarios
- Test system performance under load

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Test normal user flows
- Test error handling

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- High risks affecting security

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- None at this time

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Code validation attempt patterns
- Failed validation rates
- Unusual access patterns
- System performance metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Server-side validation implemented
- Rate limiting added
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance issues reported
