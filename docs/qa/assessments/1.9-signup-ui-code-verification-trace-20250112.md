  - Then: Returns validation result with appropriate error messages

- **Integration Test**: `1.9-INT-003: Database code lookup`
  - Given: Valid signup code exists in database
  - When: Code validation API is called
  - Then: Database returns code details (active, not expired, within limits)

- **Integration Test**: `1.9-INT-004: Expired code handling`
  - Given: User submits expired signup code
  - When: Code validation is performed
  - Then: System returns "code expired" error message

- **Integration Test**: `1.9-INT-005: Usage limit enforcement`
  - Given: Signup code has reached usage limit
  - When: User attempts to use the code
  - Then: System returns "code usage limit exceeded" error

#### AC4: Account Creation Flow

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `1.9-INT-006: Supabase auth user creation`
  - Given: Valid signup code and user data
  - When: Account creation process is initiated
  - Then: Supabase auth user is created successfully

- **Integration Test**: `1.9-INT-007: Profile and tier record creation`
  - Given: Auth user is created successfully
  - When: Profile creation process runs
  - Then: Profile record and user_tiers record are created with correct data

- **Integration Test**: `1.9-INT-008: Code usage logging`
  - Given: User successfully creates account with signup code
  - When: Account creation completes
  - Then: Code usage is logged (used_count incremented, last_used_at updated)

- **E2E Test**: `1.9-E2E-003: Complete sign-up to dashboard`
  - Given: User starts sign-up process
  - When: User completes entire sign-up flow
  - Then: User is redirected to dashboard with proper authentication

#### AC5: Error Handling & UX

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `1.9-UNIT-008: Error message generation`
  - Given: Various error conditions occur
  - When: Error handling logic is triggered
  - Then: Appropriate user-friendly error messages are generated

- **Integration Test**: `1.9-INT-009: Network error handling`
  - Given: Network connection fails during sign-up
  - When: User attempts to submit form
  - Then: System shows network error message with retry option

- **Integration Test**: `1.9-INT-010: Email exists error handling`
  - Given: User attempts to sign up with existing email
  - When: Account creation is attempted
  - Then: System returns "email already exists" error message

### Critical Gaps

**No gaps identified** - All acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage across unit, integration, and E2E levels.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on the traceability analysis, the test design provides:

1. **Complete Coverage**: Every AC has multiple test scenarios
2. **Appropriate Test Levels**: Unit tests for logic, integration for interactions, E2E for journeys
3. **Security Focus**: Code validation and account creation have robust testing
4. **User Experience**: Form interactions and error handling are well covered

### Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: All requirements have full test coverage
- **Security Requirements**: Code validation and account creation have multiple test levels
- **User Experience**: Form interactions and error scenarios are thoroughly tested
- **Data Integrity**: Account creation flow has comprehensive validation

### Coverage Quality Indicators

✅ **Every AC has at least one test**
✅ **Critical paths have multiple test levels**
✅ **Edge cases are explicitly covered**
✅ **Security requirements have appropriate test types**
✅ **Clear Given-When-Then for each test**

### Test Execution Strategy

1. **Unit Tests First**: Validate business logic and algorithms
2. **Integration Tests Second**: Verify component interactions and database operations
3. **E2E Tests Last**: Confirm complete user journeys
4. **Security Tests**: Focus on code validation and account creation
5. **Error Scenarios**: Test all failure modes and edge cases

### Traceability Validation

- **Requirements Coverage**: 100% (5/5 ACs covered)
- **Test Level Distribution**: Balanced across unit (8), integration (7), E2E (3)
- **Security Coverage**: Comprehensive for authentication and data integrity
- **User Experience**: Complete coverage of form interactions and error handling
- **Edge Cases**: All identified edge cases have corresponding tests
