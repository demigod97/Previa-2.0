- Fully Covered: 4 (80%)
- Partially Covered: 1 (20%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: UI Implementation

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `CodeVerificationInput.test.tsx::renders correctly`
  - Given: Component is rendered
  - When: Component mounts
  - Then: All input fields are present and functional

- **Unit Test**: `SignUpForm.test.tsx::renders correctly`
  - Given: Component is rendered
  - When: Component mounts
  - Then: Form fields are present and functional

- **Integration Test**: `signup-flow.integration.test.tsx::completes full sign-up flow`
  - Given: User enters valid information
  - When: User submits form
  - Then: Account is created successfully

#### AC2: Code Input Behavior

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `CodeVerificationInput.test.tsx::auto-focus navigation`
  - Given: User is on code input screen
  - When: User types a digit
  - Then: Focus moves to next input field

- **Unit Test**: `CodeVerificationInput.test.tsx::paste functionality`
  - Given: User has a 6-digit code in clipboard
  - When: User pastes into any input field
  - Then: All fields are filled automatically

#### AC3: Code Validation

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `useSignUp.test.tsx::valid code verification`
  - Given: User enters valid code
  - When: Validation is performed
  - Then: Code is accepted

- **Unit Test**: `useSignUp.test.tsx::invalid code rejection`
  - Given: User enters invalid code
  - When: Validation is performed
  - Then: Code is rejected with error message

- **Integration Test**: `signup-flow.integration.test.tsx::handles invalid verification code`
  - Given: User enters invalid code
  - When: User submits form
  - Then: Error message is displayed

#### AC4: Account Creation

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `signup-flow.integration.test.tsx::completes full sign-up flow`
  - Given: User enters valid information and code
  - When: User submits form
  - Then: Account is created and user is redirected

- **Integration Test**: `signup-flow.integration.test.tsx::handles email already exists error`
  - Given: User enters existing email
  - When: User submits form
  - Then: Error message is displayed

#### AC5: Error Handling

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `SignUpForm.test.tsx::error message display`
  - Given: An error occurs
  - When: Error is handled
  - Then: Error message is displayed to user

- **Integration Test**: `signup-flow.integration.test.tsx::handles invalid verification code`
  - Given: User enters invalid code
  - When: Validation fails
  - Then: Error message is displayed

**Coverage Gap**: No test for network error handling

### Critical Gaps

1. **Security Requirements**
   - Gap: No test for client-side validation bypass
   - Risk: High - Security vulnerability
   - Action: Add security testing for validation bypass

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Gap: No load testing for concurrent users
   - Risk: Medium - Performance issues under load
   - Action: Add load testing with multiple concurrent users

3. **Error Handling**
   - Gap: No test for network error scenarios
   - Risk: Low - User experience issues
   - Action: Add network error handling tests

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Security Testing**
   - Test code bypass scenarios
   - Test server-side validation (when implemented)
   - Test rate limiting (when implemented)

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Load testing with concurrent users
   - Database query performance testing
   - Response time testing

3. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Network error scenarios
   - Timeout handling
   - Retry mechanisms

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Requirements with security gaps
- **Medium Risk**: Requirements with performance gaps
- **Low Risk**: Requirements with minor coverage gaps

## Traceability Best Practices

### Given-When-Then for Mapping (Not Test Code)

Use Given-When-Then to document what each test validates:

**Given**: The initial context the test sets up
- What state/data the test prepares
- User context being simulated
- System preconditions

**When**: The action the test performs
- What the test executes
- API calls or user actions tested
- Events triggered

**Then**: What the test asserts
- Expected outcomes verified
- State changes checked
- Values validated

**Note**: This is for documentation only. Actual test code follows project standards.

### Coverage Priority

Prioritize coverage based on:

1. Critical business flows
2. Security-related requirements
3. Data integrity requirements
4. User-facing features
5. Performance SLAs

### Test Granularity

Map at appropriate levels:

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for component interaction
- E2E tests for user journeys
- Performance tests for NFRs

## Quality Indicators

Good traceability shows:

- Every AC has at least one test
- Critical paths have multiple test levels
- Edge cases are explicitly covered
- NFRs have appropriate test types
- Clear Given-When-Then for each test

## Red Flags

Watch for:

- ACs with no test coverage
- Tests that don't map to requirements
- Vague test descriptions
- Missing edge case coverage
- NFRs without specific tests

## Integration with Gates

This traceability feeds into quality gates:

- Critical gaps → FAIL
- Minor gaps → CONCERNS
- Missing P0 tests from test-design → CONCERNS

## Key Principles

- Every requirement must be testable
- Use Given-When-Then for clarity
- Identify both presence and absence
- Prioritize based on risk
- Make recommendations actionable
