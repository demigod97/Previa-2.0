# NFR Assessment: 2.1

Date: 2025-10-14
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Frontend uses Supabase Auth; default localStorage session poses XSS exposure risk. Prefer httpOnly cookies if feasible; avoid email enumeration in errors; backend rate limiting not evidenced.
- Performance: CONCERNS - No explicit targets. Recommend TTI < 2s for Welcome/Auth on mid-tier devices; auth API p95 < 500ms.
- Reliability: PASS - Error handling outlined; `onAuthStateChange` for session; gamification non-blocking.
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Tests planned but no targets. Recommend â‰¥80% coverage for new modules; schema validation tests and service error-path tests.

## Critical Issues

1. Missing explicit performance targets (Performance)
   - Risk: Unclear expectations can hide regressions
   - Fix: Define TTI and API latency targets; add basic Web Vitals capture

2. Session storage security posture (Security)
   - Risk: Token exposure if XSS when using localStorage
   - Fix: Prefer Supabase auth cookies (httpOnly) or enforce CSP + strict input handling

## Quick Wins

- Document performance SLAs for Welcome/Auth
- Enable Supabase cookie-based sessions if architecture allows
- Add unit tests for zod schemas and error rendering; add session persistence integration test
