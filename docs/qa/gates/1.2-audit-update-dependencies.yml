# Gate Decision Logic Applied
decision_logic: |
  Gate Decision: CONCERNS

  Reasons for CONCERNS (not PASS):
  1. Testing Infrastructure: Vitest not installed despite package.json scripts referencing it
  2. Test Coverage: 0 of 12 P0 tests implemented from test design
  3. Task Incomplete: Task 48 "Run existing tests" remains unchecked
  4. Testing Strategy: Story testing requirements not met

  Reasons for CONCERNS (not FAIL):
  1. Core Objectives Met: All dependency and security work substantially complete (92%)
  2. Build Verification: Production build and dev server validation provide confidence
  3. Risk Appropriate: Infrastructure work with no runtime logic changes requiring tests
  4. Documented Gap: Testing deficiency clearly identified with two clear paths forward
  5. Business Value: Story delivers production value (secure, current dependencies) without tests
  6. Security Excellence: 6 of 7 vulnerabilities resolved (86% success rate)
  7. AC Performance: 5.5 of 6 ACs met (92% complete)

  Per review-story task decision criteria:
  - No risk score ≥ 9 (highest is TEST-001 at 4)
  - NFR statuses: All PASS
  - Top issues: 1 medium, 2 low (no high/critical)
  → Gate = CONCERNS (advisory, not blocker)

  Post-Implementation Improvements:
  - Risk Score: 63/100 → 28/100 (LOW RISK)
  - Security: 7 vulnerabilities → 1 vulnerability (acceptable exception)
  - Dependencies: Out of date → Current and compatible
  - Build: Unknown state → Verified successful

# Path to PASS Gate
path_to_pass:
  option_a: "Accept testing gap as documented technical debt (RECOMMENDED)"
  option_a_steps:
    - "Create follow-up story 1.2.1: Setup Test Infrastructure"
    - "Document xlsx vulnerability in risk register"
    - "Add task 48 exception note: 'Tests deferred to story 1.2.1'"
    - "Mark story DONE with documented testing gap"
  option_a_effort: "30 minutes"
  option_a_rationale: "Dependency management scope complete. Testing infrastructure is substantial separate work."

  option_b: "Complete testing now before marking Done"
  option_b_steps:
    - "Install Vitest: npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui"
    - "Implement 5 critical tests (subset of 12 P0)"
    - "Verify all tests pass"
    - "Update File List and Dev Agent Record"
    - "Mark story DONE"
  option_b_effort: "3-4 hours"
  option_b_rationale: "Provides immediate test coverage but significantly expands story scope."

# Review History
history:
  - at: "2025-01-10T00:00:00Z"
    gate: FAIL
    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "Pre-implementation assessment. Story not ready - no tasks completed, 7 security vulnerabilities, no tests. Comprehensive planning guidance provided."

  - at: "2025-01-10T18:00:00Z"
    gate: CONCERNS
    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "Post-implementation review. Excellent progress: 48 of 49 tasks complete (98%), 6 of 7 vulnerabilities resolved, all financial libraries added, build verified. Testing infrastructure incomplete but scope appropriate for dependency story. Recommended: Accept testing gap, create follow-up story."

# Notes for Team
team_notes: |
  EXCELLENT WORK on dependency updates! This implementation demonstrates strong engineering practices:

  ✅ STRENGTHS:
  - Security-first approach (Vite 5.4.1 → 6.3.6 resolved 8 CVEs)
  - Systematic phase-by-phase execution
  - All required financial libraries added with appropriate versions
  - Build verified successful (517.94 kB, 2.71s build time)
  - Clear documentation in Dev Agent Record
  - Business-justified exception for xlsx vulnerability

  ⚠️ TESTING GAP:
  The primary gap is testing infrastructure. Two options:

  OPTION A (RECOMMENDED): Accept this as documented technical debt
  - Rationale: Testing infrastructure setup is substantial separate work (3-5 hours)
  - Action: Create story 1.2.1 for test infrastructure
  - Benefit: Keeps dependency story focused and allows specialized test story

  OPTION B: Complete testing now before marking Done
  - Rationale: Provides immediate test coverage
  - Action: Install Vitest + implement 5 basic tests (3-4 hours)
  - Tradeoff: Expands story scope significantly

  📊 QUALITY METRICS:
  - Quality Score: 78/100 (Acceptable with Concerns)
  - Risk Score: 28/100 (LOW RISK, down from 63/100)
  - AC Completion: 5.5 of 6 (92%)
  - Security: 6 of 7 resolved (86%)

  🎯 RECOMMENDATION:
  Mark this story DONE with Option A (documented testing gap + follow-up story).
  The dependency work is production-ready and delivers substantial value.
