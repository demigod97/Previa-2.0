  - id: "DATA-001"
    original_severity: medium
    resolution: "RESOLVED - ALL monetary amounts converted to integer cents throughout financial-data.ts. Added inline comments (e.g., '1050 // $10.50 in cents'). Sample tests demonstrate financial calculation patterns."
    verified_by: "Code review + 21/21 financial calculation tests passing"

  - id: "TECH-001"
    original_severity: medium
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Added comprehensive edge case fixtures: mockFailedOCRReceipt, mockTimeoutReceipt, mockInvalidFormatReceipt, mockLowConfidenceReceipt, mockCorruptedBankStatement, mockNetworkFailureUpload, mockPerfectMatch, mockPoorMatch. Includes getEdgeCaseFixtures() helper."
    verified_by: "Code review - fixtures cover all scenarios from story lines 115-120"

  - id: "OPS-001"
    original_severity: low
    resolution: "RESOLVED - Created docs/testing-guide.md (500+ lines) covering testing philosophy, infrastructure setup, financial testing patterns, mock data usage, Supabase mocking strategies, RLS testing, and troubleshooting."
