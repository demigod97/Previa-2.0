nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'RLS policies enforced via Supabase types. Tier data properly sanitized in logs. No hardcoded secrets. User ID validation in hooks.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'React Query caching (5min staleTime) minimizes database calls. Tier data fetched only when needed (enabled flag). Efficient type transformations.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with retry logic (2 retries, 1s delay). Graceful fallbacks for missing tier data. Clear error messages for users.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code organization following source-tree standards. Comprehensive JSDoc documentation. Clear separation of concerns (types, hooks, validation, UI).'
