nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: FAIL
    notes: |
      Critical vulnerabilities: No malware scanning, insufficient RLS validation, 
      predictable file paths enable enumeration. No audit trail for file access.
      Cross-reference with Story 1.9 shows pattern of underspecified security controls.
  performance:
    status: FAIL
    notes: |
      Synchronous processing blocks UI for large files. No chunked uploads.
      Polling every 2 seconds is inefficient. No CDN optimization.
      Similar issues found in Story 2.1 with async operations.
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      n8n dependency creates single point of failure. No retry logic or fallback.
      Gamification failures are silent. Pattern across Stories 2.1, 5.6 shows 
      fragile error handling.
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: |
      No monitoring/alerting infrastructure. Testing coverage gaps.
      Cross-story analysis reveals systemic testing execution issues.

cross_story_patterns:
  pattern_1:
    title: 'Incomplete Error Handling'
    affected_stories: ['1.9', '2.1', '2.2']
    description: 'Error handling consistently treats failures as log and ignore with no retry mechanisms'
    recommendation: 'Establish project-wide error handling standards with retry queues and user notification'
  
  pattern_2:
    title: 'Security Controls Underspecified'
    affected_stories: ['1.9', '2.1', '2.2']
    description: 'RLS policies and input validation mentioned but not comprehensively tested'
    recommendation: 'Create security checklist required for all stories, mandate security reviews'
  
  pattern_3:
    title: 'Testing Coverage Gaps'
    affected_stories: ['1.9', '5.6', '2.2']
    description: 'Testing sections documented but not consistently executed, integration tests failing'
    recommendation: 'Make test execution evidence required for story completion, block merging without passing tests'
  
  pattern_4:
    title: 'Gamification Fragility'
    affected_stories: ['2.1', '5.6', '2.2']
    description: 'Gamification treated as non-critical with no failure recovery'
    recommendation: 'Either make gamification reliable with retry queues or make it truly optional with degraded mode'
