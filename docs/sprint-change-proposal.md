# Sprint Change Proposal: Brownfield Pivot to Previa Financial Platform

**Date:** 2025-01-08  
**Prepared by:** John (Product Manager)  
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

**Change Trigger:**  
Acquired existing PolicyAi application (policy document management system) and pivoting to build Previa, an AI-driven financial intelligence platform for Australian households, freelancers, and small businesses.

**Change Type:**  
Brownfield-to-greenfield pivot - Reusing infrastructure patterns (Supabase Auth, Edge Functions, n8n webhooks, file uploads) but building entirely new product with different domain model, user roles, and UI/UX.

**Impact Level:** üî¥ **HIGH** - Requires comprehensive specification updates before epic/story creation

**Approval Status:** ‚úÖ **APPROVED**

---

## 1. Issue Identification

### Triggering Situation
- **Context:** Planning-stage foundational work for financial platform
- **Asset:** Existing PolicyAi codebase with working auth, uploads, chat, roles
- **Challenge:** Need to adapt for completely different domain (policies ‚Üí financial reconciliation)

### Core Problems Identified

**Problem A: Domain Model Mismatch**
- **Current:** `policies`, `policy_revisions`, `sources`, `notebooks` (document management)
- **Needed:** `bank_accounts`, `bank_statements`, `receipts`, `transactions`, `reconciliation_matches` (financial data)
- **Resolution:** Complete data model rewrite in Architecture document

**Problem B: Role Semantics Mismatch**
- **Current:** `administrator`, `executive`, `board` (corporate hierarchy)
- **Needed:** `user`, `premium_user` (freemium tier-based)
- **Resolution:** Updated role structure aligned with business model

**Problem C: UI/UX Complete Redesign Needed**
- **Current:** Generic policy dashboard with chat/notebooks
- **Needed:** 
  - Interactive onboarding for bank account setup
  - OCR extraction UI with confidence indicators
  - Transaction-receipt matching interface (reconciliation engine)
  - Multi-view dashboard (home/reconciliation/transactions/chat)
  - Previa brand identity (colors, logo)
  - shadcn/ui component system with MCP
- **Resolution:** Complete Frontend Specification rewrite

**Problem D: Workflow Logic Differences**
- **Current:** RAG pipeline for policy Q&A
- **Needed:** OCR ‚Üí extraction ‚Üí transaction matching ‚Üí reconciliation approval
- **Resolution:** Can reuse n8n/Edge Function patterns but with different business logic

## 2. Epic Impact Assessment

### Original Epic Structure (PRD v1.0)

| Epic | Original Goal | Status |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Epic 1 | Foundation & Core Services | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs modification |
| Epic 2 | Manual Data Ingestion & Reconciliation | üî¥ Too broad, needs splitting |
| Epic 3 | User Dashboard & Financial Insights | üî¥ Missing multi-view details |
| Epic 4 | Data Export & Integrations | ‚úÖ Can proceed as-is |

### Updated Epic Structure (PRD v1.1)

| Epic | Updated Goal | Changes |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Epic 1** | Foundation & Core Services | **Modified:** Add financial schema, user/premium_user roles, Previa branding, shadcn/ui setup |
| **Epic 2** | User Onboarding & Bank Account Setup | **NEW:** Split from Epic 2 - Interactive 5-7 step onboarding flow |
| **Epic 3** | Document Upload & OCR Processing | **NEW:** Split from Epic 2 - Upload hub, OCR pipeline, status tracking |
| **Epic 4** | AI Reconciliation Engine & Matching UI | **NEW:** Split from Epic 2 - Core matching interface inspired by Monarch/Expensify |
| **Epic 5** | Multi-View Dashboard & Financial Insights | **Modified:** Expand to 4 dashboard views + gamification |
| **Epic 6** | Data Export & Integrations | **Keep:** No changes needed |

**Rationale for 4 ‚Üí 6 Epics:**  
Original Epic 2 contained 3 major UI-intensive features that each deserve dedicated focus:
1. Onboarding (first impression, bank setup)
2. Upload/OCR (document processing pipeline)
3. Reconciliation (core differentiator, complex UX)

Splitting ensures proper story scoping and reduces epic bloat.

## 4. Recommended Path Forward

### Selected Approach: Option 1 - Direct Adjustment / Integration

**Rationale:**
- ‚úÖ We're in planning stage - no code to throw away
- ‚úÖ PRD foundation is solid - just needs enhancement
- ‚úÖ Architecture needs targeted updates, not complete rewrite
- ‚úÖ Frontend Spec needs complete rebuild (expected for domain pivot)
- ‚úÖ All work is directly actionable and feeds into story creation

### Three-Phase Sequential Approach

**Phase 1: Update PRD** (PM Agent - John)
- ‚úÖ Expand to 6 epics with clear UI-focused goals
- ‚úÖ Add branding section (Previa colors, logo)
- ‚úÖ Enhance UI Design Goals with competitor references
- ‚úÖ Add FR8 for onboarding workflow
- **Status:** COMPLETE

**Phase 2: Update Architecture** (Architect Agent - Winston)
- ‚úÖ Rewrite Section 6 (Data Models) with financial schema
- ‚úÖ Update Section 7 (RLS) for user/premium_user roles
- ‚úÖ Refine Section 5 (Edge Functions) for reconciliation endpoints
- ‚úÖ Update n8n workflow descriptions for OCR ‚Üí extraction ‚Üí matching
- **Status:** COMPLETE

**Phase 3: Create New Frontend Spec** (UX Expert Agent - Sally)
- ‚úÖ Complete rewrite using shadcn MCP approach
- ‚úÖ Design onboarding flow (7 steps)
- ‚úÖ Specify 4 dashboard views (home/reconciliation/tables/chat)
- ‚úÖ Detail all components with Previa color palette
- ‚úÖ Reference Monarch/Expensify/PocketSmith patterns
- ‚úÖ Mobile-first responsive design
- **Status:** COMPLETE

## 5. MVP Scope Impact Assessment

### Original MVP Scope (from Project Brief)
- User onboarding ‚úÖ Still in scope, now detailed
- Manual upload (statements/receipts) ‚úÖ Still in scope
- AI reconciliation ‚úÖ Still in scope, UI designed
- Financial dashboard ‚úÖ Still in scope, multi-view
- Gamification ‚úÖ Still in scope, refined
- Data export ‚úÖ Still in scope

### MVP Goals Still Valid?
‚úÖ **YES** - All original goals remain:
- 70% automation target
- User retention goals
- Time-saving value prop (5+ hours/week)
- Product-market fit validation
- Freemium business model

### Re-scoping Needed?
‚ùå **NO** - Scope is unchanged; we've added specification detail, not features

### Risk Assessment
- üü¢ **Low risk of scope creep** - We're adding specification detail, not features
- üü° **Medium risk of timeline extension** - UI-first approach adds ~2 weeks upfront work but reduces dev rework
- üü¢ **Low risk of MVP viability** - All core features remain achievable
