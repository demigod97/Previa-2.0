## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the foundation story for Previa development.

### Architecture Context
- **Tech Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS [Source: architecture/1-goals-scope-constraints.md]
- **Frontend Framework:** React SPA with Supabase client integration [Source: architecture/3-high-level-architecture.md]
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with AuthContext for session management [Source: architecture/4-frontend-architecture-auth-roles-chat-uploads.md]
- **UI Library:** shadcn/ui components with Previa design system [Source: frontend-spec-new.md]

### Design System Requirements
**Previa Brand Colors:** [Source: frontend-spec-new.md#1.1]
- Primary background: Cream (#F2E9D8)
- Primary text: Charcoal (#403B31)
- Secondary text: Stone (#8C877D)
- Accent/Interactive: Sand (#D9C8B4)
- Emphasis: Dark Stone (#595347)

**Typography:** [Source: frontend-spec-new.md#1.2]
- Headings: Inter (Bold/Semibold)
- Body: Inter (Regular/Medium)
- Numbers/Amounts: JetBrains Mono

### Component Specifications
**Current PolicyAi Components to Remove:** [Source: project structure analysis]
- src/components/policy-document/ (entire directory)
- src/components/notebook/ (entire directory)
- src/components/chat/PolicyChatInterface.tsx
- src/components/chat/PolicyCitationComponent.tsx
- src/hooks/usePolicyChat.tsx
- src/hooks/usePolicyDocumentRoleAssignment.tsx
- src/pages/Notebook.tsx

**Components to Preserve:** [Source: architecture/4-frontend-architecture-auth-roles-chat-uploads.md]
- src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx (maintains user + session state)
- src/components/auth/ (ProtectedRoute, AuthForm)
- src/integrations/supabase/ (Supabase client configuration)

### File Locations
**Preserve Infrastructure:**
- `src/integrations/supabase/` - Supabase client and configuration
- `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context
- `src/components/auth/` - Authentication components

**Update for Branding:**
- `index.html` - Update title and meta tags
- `src/App.tsx` - Update routing and navigation
- `src/components/dashboard/` - Update to show Previa branding

### Technical Constraints
- **Preserve Supabase Infrastructure:** Do not modify database schema or authentication setup [Source: TECHNICAL-DECISIONS.md#8]
- **Maintain Authentication Flow:** AuthContext pattern must remain functional [Source: architecture/4-frontend-architecture-auth-roles-chat-uploads.md]
- **UI Framework:** Continue using shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS [Source: TECHNICAL-DECISIONS.md#9]

### Testing
Testing requirements based on testing-strategy from architecture documents:
- **Unit Tests:** Test that authentication components still function after cleanup
- **Integration Tests:** Verify Supabase connection and auth flow
- **Manual Testing:** Verify application runs without errors and shows Previa branding
- **Accessibility:** Ensure removed components don't break navigation or focus management

Test file location: `src/test/` directory
Testing frameworks: Vitest for unit tests, manual verification for integration
Specific testing requirements: Authentication flow, Supabase connection, error-free startup
