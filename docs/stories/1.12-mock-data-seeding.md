## Status: Ready for Done

## Epic
Epic 1: Foundation & Core Services

## Story
**As a** newly signed up user,  
**I want** to seed my account with realistic mock data (bank accounts, transactions, and achievements) and delete it when needed,  
**So that** I can immediately experience the platform's value and explore features without manual data entry, and clean up when I'm done testing.

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context
**Current TopBar Implementation:**
- File: `src/components/layout/TopBar.tsx` - Contains Discord button and user menu
- Uses: shadcn/ui Button component with Previa styling
- Auth context: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` manages user state
- Toast system: shadcn/ui Toast for notifications

**Database Schema (from architecture docs):**
```sql
-- Bank accounts table
CREATE TABLE bank_accounts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  institution TEXT NOT NULL,
  account_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  account_number_masked TEXT,
  balance DECIMAL(15,2),
  currency TEXT DEFAULT 'AUD',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Transactions table
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  bank_statement_id UUID REFERENCES bank_statements(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  transaction_date DATE NOT NULL,
  amount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category TEXT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'unreconciled'
);

-- Gamification tables (from Story 5.6)
CREATE TABLE gamification_profiles (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  total_points INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  current_level INTEGER DEFAULT 1
);

CREATE TABLE user_badges (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  badge_id TEXT,
  earned_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Integration Approach
**Component Structure:**
1. Update `src/components/layout/TopBar.tsx`:
   - Add "Seed Mock Data" button next to Discord button
   - Add loading state and click handler
   - Import and use toast for notifications

2. Create `src/hooks/useMockDataSeeding.ts`:
   - Custom hook for mock data generation
   - Handles loading states and error handling
   - Calls Edge Function and shows toast notifications

3. Create `supabase/functions/seed-mock-data/index.ts`:
   - Edge Function for secure data generation
   - Validates user authentication
   - Generates realistic Australian financial data
   - Uses service role for database operations

### Technical Constraints
**Australian Data Requirements:**
- **Bank Institutions:** Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac, NAB
- **Realistic Merchants:** Woolworths, Coles, BP, Shell, AGL, Telstra, etc.
- **Transaction Patterns:** Salary on 1st/15th, groceries weekly, fuel bi-weekly
- **Amount Ranges:** Based on Australian cost of living and income patterns

**Security Requirements:**
- All data generation must happen server-side (Edge Function)
- Use Supabase service role for database operations
- Validate user authentication before data generation
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse (1 request per user per hour)

### File Locations

```

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Tests:**
- Mock data button renders correctly
- Loading states work properly
- Toast notifications display correctly

**Integration Tests:**
- Edge Function generates realistic data
- Database operations complete successfully
- Gamification data is properly seeded

**E2E Tests:**
- Complete flow: button click → data generation → success notification
- Error handling: network failures, invalid responses
- Rate limiting: multiple rapid clicks are handled

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks
- **Primary Risk**: Generated data might not be realistic enough for Australian context
- **Mitigation**: Use real Australian bank names, merchant names, and transaction patterns from research
- **Verification**: Manual review of generated data for Australian authenticity

- **Secondary Risk**: Edge Function might fail during data generation
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper error handling and rollback mechanisms
- **Verification**: Test Edge Function with various failure scenarios

### Rollback Plan
- Remove "Seed Mock Data" button from TopBar.tsx
- Delete Edge Function from supabase/functions/
- Remove useMockDataSeeding hook
- Generated data can be deleted by user or admin

### Safety Checks
- [ ] Existing TopBar functionality tested before changes
- [ ] Changes isolated to new components (no breaking changes)
- [ ] Edge Function uses service role safely
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [ ] Mock data button added to TopBar with proper styling
- [ ] Edge Function generates realistic Australian financial data
- [ ] Gamification data properly seeded
- [ ] Loading states and error handling implemented
- [ ] Toast notifications working correctly
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] No regression in existing TopBar functionality
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and TypeScript standards
- [ ] Tests pass (unit, integration, E2E)

## Notes
- **Australian Context**: All generated data must reflect Australian banking, merchants, and financial patterns
- **Data Realism**: Use real Australian bank names, merchant names, and transaction descriptions
- **Security**: All data generation happens server-side via Edge Function
- **User Experience**: Button provides immediate value to new users exploring the platform
- **Gamification**: Seeded data should trigger appropriate badges and points to demonstrate the system

**CORS Fix Details:**

On 2025-01-12, discovered production error "Data Generation Failed: Failed to send a request to the Edge Function" with 405 Method Not Allowed for OPTIONS requests. Root cause: Edge Function was not handling browser CORS preflight requests.

**Fix Applied:**

1. Added OPTIONS request handler returning 204 No Content with CORS headers
2. Added `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` to all response types:
   - OPTIONS (204)
   - Method not allowed (405)
   - Authorization errors (401) - 2 locations
   - Rate limit error (429)
   - Success response (200)
   - Server error (500)
3. Set `Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400` for 24-hour browser caching

**Deployment Note:**

The Edge Function with CORS fix needs to be redeployed manually via Supabase Dashboard:

1. Navigate to [Supabase Functions Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/clfdfkkyurghuohjnryy/functions)
2. Click on "seed-mock-data" function (slug: smooth-processor)
3. Copy complete updated code from `supabase/functions/seed-mock-data/index.ts`
4. Replace existing code in dashboard editor
5. Click "Deploy" button
6. Wait for deployment confirmation

**Current Edge Function Status:**

- Function ID: 1b96f53c-339d-4dd1-bf01-ea3722a98399
- Slug: smooth-processor
- Version: 1 (deployed without CORS)
- Status: ACTIVE but requires update

**Next Steps After Deployment:**

1. Test production functionality with "Seed Mock Data" button
2. Verify OPTIONS request returns 204 with CORS headers
3. Verify POST request succeeds with data generation
4. Run complete integration test suite
5. Verify database operations and gamification data
