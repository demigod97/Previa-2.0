- Implement security test validation (P0 tests)

**Post-Fix Validation:**
- npm audit must show 0 high/critical
- Security tests (1.2-INT-008 through 011) must pass
- Development server access controls must work

---

### Performance Considerations

**Current State:** Unknown (no implementation yet)

**Monitoring Required:**
- Build time should not increase >2x baseline
- Bundle size should not increase >20%
- Development server startup time
- Hot module replacement (HMR) functionality

**Test Coverage:**
- Bundle size test (1.2-E2E-003)
- Build performance monitoring
- HMR validation (1.2-E2E-005)

---
