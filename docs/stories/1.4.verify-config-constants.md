## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 cleaned UI, Story 1.2 updated dependencies, Story 1.3 deployed database schema. This story ensures configuration constants align with the established database schema and technical decisions.

### Architecture Context
- **Business Rules:** Constants define core financial processing behavior [Source: TECHNICAL-DECISIONS.md#2, #3]
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript types enforce configuration consistency [Source: architecture/1-goals-scope-constraints.md]
- **Freemium Model:** Tier limits drive business model implementation [Source: TECHNICAL-DECISIONS.md#3]

### Configuration Analysis
**Constants File Status:** [Source: src/config/constants.ts analysis]
- ✅ **Comprehensive coverage:** OCR, reconciliation, tiers, processing, UI, gamification
- ✅ **Well-documented:** Each constant has purpose and decision reference
- ✅ **Type-safe:** Proper TypeScript types and const assertions
- ✅ **Business-aligned:** Values match technical decisions document

**OCR Thresholds Verification:** [Source: TECHNICAL-DECISIONS.md#2]
- `OCR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER_THRESHOLD = 0.90` ✅ Matches decision document
- `OCR_RECEIPT_DATA_THRESHOLD = 0.90` ✅ Ensures financial accuracy
- Below 90%: Flag for manual review (correct behavior)
- Between 90-95%: Extract but require confirmation (good UX)

**Reconciliation Thresholds:** [Source: TECHNICAL-DECISIONS.md#2]
- `RECONCILIATION_AUTO_APPROVE_THRESHOLD = 0.95` ✅ Prevents false positives
- `RECONCILIATION_SUGGEST_THRESHOLD = 0.70` ✅ Good balance for suggestions
- Weight distribution: 40% date + 40% amount + 20% merchant = 100% ✅

**Tier Limits Verification:** [Source: TECHNICAL-DECISIONS.md#3 + migration schema]
- FREE: 3 accounts, 50 trans/month, 10 receipts/month ✅ Matches database schema
- PREMIUM: Unlimited (999999) ✅ Effectively unlimited while avoiding null issues
- Error messages reference correct tier limits ✅

### File Processing Configuration
**File Support:** [Source: frontend-spec-new.md#2.3, #2.7]
- Statements: PDF, CSV ✅ Covers major bank export formats
- Receipts: PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG ✅ Covers camera captures and digital receipts
- Max size: 50MB ✅ Reasonable for high-resolution scans

**Processing Timeouts:**
- 30 seconds before showing "processing" status ✅ Good UX balance
- Prevents user confusion while allowing for complex OCR operations

### UI Configuration Analysis
**Pagination Values:** [Source: frontend-spec-new.md]
- Transactions: 25 per page ✅ Good balance for table performance
- Receipts: 20 per page ✅ Suitable for card/grid layouts
- Matches: 15 per page ✅ Appropriate for detailed matching interface

**Dashboard Configuration:**
- Default 30-day range ✅ Covers monthly spending patterns
- Gamification points ✅ Balanced to encourage engagement without spam

### Integration Points
**Constants Usage Requirements:**
- Replace hardcoded file size limits with MAX_FILE_SIZE
- Use TIER_LIMITS in freemium upgrade prompts
- Apply OCR thresholds in document processing workflows
- Use reconciliation weights in AI matching algorithm

### Technical Constraints
- **Type Safety:** All constants must have proper TypeScript types [Source: architecture/1-goals-scope-constraints.md]
- **Documentation:** Each constant needs purpose and decision reference [Source: TECHNICAL-DECISIONS.md]
- **Consistency:** Values must align with database schema and business rules [Source: migration files]
- **Maintainability:** Constants should be the single source of truth for business rules

### Enhancement Opportunities
**Potential Additions:**
- Currency formatting constants for AUD display
- Date format constants for Australian date conventions
- Timezone configuration for Australia/Sydney
- Export format constants (CSV headers, etc.)

### Testing
**Configuration Testing:**
- Verify all constants are properly imported where needed
- Test type safety with TypeScript compilation
- Validate constants align with database schema values
- Check error messages render correctly in UI

**Integration Testing:**
- Test tier limit enforcement using these constants
- Verify OCR threshold behavior in document processing
- Test file upload validation with size and format limits

Test file location: `src/test/config/` directory
Testing frameworks: Unit tests with Vitest for constant validation
Specific testing requirements: Type safety, value consistency, proper imports
