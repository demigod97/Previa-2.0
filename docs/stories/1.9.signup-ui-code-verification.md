# Story 1.9: Sign-up UI with Code Verification

## Status
Done

## Epic
Epic 1: Foundation & Core Services

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to sign up for Previa with a verification code,
**so that** I can create an account and access the financial intelligence platform.

## Context Source
- Source Document: User request + Current authentication system analysis
- Enhancement Type: New feature (sign-up flow)
- Existing System Impact: Extends current sign-in only authentication

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Sign-up Form UI
- [x] Sign-up form displays with email, password, and confirm password fields
- [x] Form follows Previa design system (colors: #F2E9D8 bg, #403B31 text, #D9C8B4 accents)
- [x] Password strength indicator shows real-time feedback
- [x] Password must be minimum 6 characters (matches Supabase default)
- [x] Form includes toggle between "Sign In" and "Sign Up" modes

### AC2: 6-Field Verification Code Input
- [x] After initial sign-up submission, show 6-field code entry UI
- [x] UI inspired by 2FA patterns: 6 separate input fields for code digits
- [x] Auto-focus moves to next field on digit entry
- [x] Backspace moves to previous field
- [x] Code fields accept only numeric input (0-9)
- [x] Visual feedback on code entry (filled/empty states)
- [x] Paste functionality works (pastes full 6-digit code across fields)

### AC3: Verification Code Validation
- [x] On code submission, validate against `signup_codes` table
- [x] Check code is active (not deactivated)
- [x] Check code hasn't expired (if expiry_date set)
- [x] Check usage limits haven't been reached (if use_limit set)
- [x] Show clear error messages for invalid/expired/deactivated codes

### AC4: Account Creation Flow
- [x] On valid code verification, create Supabase auth user
- [x] Create profile record in `profiles` table
- [x] Create default `user_tiers` record with tier='user'
- [x] Log code usage in `signup_codes` (increment used_count, log last_used_at)
- [x] Send success toast notification
- [x] Redirect to onboarding flow (Epic 2 placeholder for now)

### AC5: Error Handling & UX
- [x] Handle email already exists error gracefully
- [x] Handle network errors with retry option
- [x] Show loading states during async operations
- [x] Form is disabled during submission
- [x] Clear, helpful error messages for all failure scenarios

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context
**Current Authentication:** 
- File: `src/components/auth/AuthForm.tsx` - Currently handles sign-in only
- Uses: `@supabase/supabase-js` client from `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- Auth context: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` manages auth state

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Already exists
auth.users (Supabase managed)
public.profiles (id UUID PK references auth.users)
public.user_tiers (user_id UUID references auth.users, tier TEXT CHECK(tier IN ('user', 'premium_user')))

-- To be created in Story 1.10
public.signup_codes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  use_limit INTEGER,
  used_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  expiry_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_used_at TIMESTAMPTZ
)
```

### Integration Approach
**Component Structure:**
1. Update `src/components/auth/AuthForm.tsx`:
   - Add state for mode ('signin' | 'signup')
   - Add toggle between sign-in and sign-up
   - Keep existing sign-in logic intact

2. Create `src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx`:
   - Email, password, confirm password fields
   - Initial sign-up submission handler
   - Transition to code verification on success

3. Create `src/components/auth/CodeVerificationInput.tsx`:
   - 6-field input component (reusable for potential future 2FA)
   - Auto-focus and keyboard navigation logic
   - Paste handler

4. Create `src/hooks/auth/useSignUp.ts`:
   - Custom hook for sign-up logic
   - Code verification API call
   - User creation orchestration

### Technical Constraints
- **Supabase Auth Flow:**
  - Use `supabase.auth.signUp()` for user creation
  - Email confirmation can be bypassed for now (configure in Supabase dashboard: Auth > Email Templates > Confirm signup > disable)
  - After user creation, automatically sign them in

- **Code Verification:**
  - Must happen BEFORE user creation (validate code first)
  - Use Edge Function or RPC call for secure server-side validation
  - Don't expose all codes to client

### File Locations
```
src/
  components/
    auth/
      AuthForm.tsx                  # Update: Add mode toggle
      SignUpForm.tsx                # New: Main sign-up form
      CodeVerificationInput.tsx     # New: 6-field code input
  hooks/
    auth/
      useSignUp.ts                  # New: Sign-up logic hook
  types/
    auth.ts                         # New: SignUpCode type definition
```

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Tests:**
- CodeVerificationInput component behavior
- Auto-focus and keyboard navigation
- Paste functionality
- Input validation (numeric only)

**Integration Tests:**
- Sign-up flow end-to-end
- Code verification with valid/invalid codes
- Error handling scenarios
- User creation and tier assignment

    use_limit INTEGER, -- NULL = unlimited
    used_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    expiry_date TIMESTAMPTZ, -- NULL = no expiry
    created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_used_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    notes TEXT -- Admin notes about the code
  );

  -- Index for fast code lookups
  CREATE INDEX idx_signup_codes_code ON public.signup_codes(code) WHERE is_active = true;
  CREATE INDEX idx_signup_codes_active ON public.signup_codes(is_active, expiry_date);
  
  -- RLS Policies (staff only can read/write - will be enforced in Story 1.10)
  ALTER TABLE public.signup_codes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks
- **Primary Risk**: Code verification happening client-side could be exploited
- **Mitigation**: Move code validation to Edge Function or Postgres RPC for server-side validation
- **Verification**: Security review of code validation flow

- **Secondary Risk**: Auto-focus navigation might break on different browsers
- **Mitigation**: Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Verification**: Cross-browser testing checklist

### Rollback Plan
- Remove signup_codes table migration
- Revert AuthForm.tsx to sign-in only
- Remove new components and hooks
- No impact on existing sign-in users

### Safety Checks
- [ ] Existing sign-in functionality tested before changes
- [ ] Changes isolated to new components (no breaking changes)
- [ ] Database migration is reversible (DROP TABLE in down migration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [ ] Unit tests pass for all new components
- [ ] Integration tests pass for complete sign-up flow
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Security review of code verification flow
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Accessibility testing completed (keyboard nav, screen readers)
- [ ] Migration applied to Supabase cloud
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)

## Notes
- **Onboarding Flow**: AC4 mentions redirect to onboarding - for now, just redirect to dashboard ('/') as Epic 2 will handle onboarding wizard
- **2FA Future**: CodeVerificationInput component is designed to be reusable for future 2FA implementation
- **Staff Roles**: Story 1.10 will add staff role system, which will restrict access to sign-up code management (Story 1.11)
- **Email Confirmation**: For MVP, email confirmation can be disabled in Supabase settings to streamline sign-up flow

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

2. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix integration test failures
3. **HIGH**: Add rate limiting for code validation
4. **HIGH**: Verify database security and RLS policies
5. **MEDIUM**: Improve error handling and user feedback
6. **LOW**: Add cross-browser testing

### Security Recommendations

1. **Server-Side Validation**: Move all code validation to server-side
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement IP-based rate limiting (max 5 attempts per hour)
3. **Audit Logging**: Log all validation attempts with timestamps and IPs
4. **Error Sanitization**: Ensure error messages don't expose system information
5. **Security Headers**: Add CSP and other security headers

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Fix Integration Tests**: Debug why code input elements aren't found
2. **Add Security Tests**: Test server-side validation thoroughly
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify auto-focus behavior across browsers
4. **Load Testing**: Test rate limiting and concurrent users
5. **Penetration Testing**: Security testing of code validation flow

### Quality Assurance Summary

While the core implementation is solid, **critical security and testing issues prevent this from being production-ready**. The story demonstrates good planning and implementation of UI components, but the security model is incomplete and integration tests are failing.

**Recommendation**: Address critical security issues and fix integration tests before considering this story complete.
